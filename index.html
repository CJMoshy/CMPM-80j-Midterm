                In 2004, Blizzard Entertainment released their first flagship MMO game, 
                World of Warcraft. Upon launch, World of Warcraft, or WoW would gain a
                cult-like following of dedicated players who would go on to spend countless 
                hours logged in. The following 15 years of game development at Blizzard would 
                go on to be influenced heavily by the community and technological advancements.

                <p>
                    In its infancy, World of Warcraft was a simple yet eloquent MMORPG that put players
                    into a fantasy world and pit them against forces of evil that connected with the prexisting 
                    backbone storyline that had been developed over years from previous Warcraft series.

                <p>
                    As time progressed, the game began to mature as well. This meant the evolution of lore, 
                    character progression, game states, and overall ambiance became expected and anticipated. 
                    The emerging demand for innovation, combined with the concurrent technological advancements
                    laid the footwork for a coordinated deployment of multi-platform support, with a fixation
                    and emphasis on mobile.

                <p>
                    Not so obviously, developers began to realize that porting World of Warcraft to mobile was a seemingly
                    impossible task, and the continuous development of the game did not help validate the argument for a mobile 
                    clone of the game.

                <p>
                    So, the development team decided to create an ‘Armory app’. This was the first step in the development of mobile
                    Warcraft. The app was designed as a way for players to view their character's stats and gear while they were away from their computer.

            <div class="box" id="p2">
                The first version of the Mobile Armory app was released in July of 2009, and featured:

                    When looking at the differences between the Mobile Armory and the base game of Wow, there is an array of examples that immediately come to mind. 
                    The mobile armory was by no means similar to World of Warcraft. Largely due to the fact that the application was launched in 2009, and mobile app 
                    technology at that time was still in its infancy. However, the technology was evolving rapidly, ultimately coining 2009 as ‘the year of the app’ (wired). 
                    For starters, the armory didn't allow any actual gameplay, only viewing and interacting with certain items or armor that your character had equipped. 
                    There was also no way to manage finances or communicate with other players in your guild (player community). Nevertheless, there were still some similarities 
                    between the two, namely the interface and HUD design was incredibly similar to the base game itself, recycling assets and fonts to replicate the environment.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="box" id="p2">
                <p>
                    As time progressed it became apparent that the ‘Mobile Armory’ was a hit. This apparent popularity ensured that the software continued to receive small improvements from developers over
                    time, but nothing significant was added. As the Warcraft series continued to flourish and technology was adapting,
                    it became increasingly apparent to developers that a larger change was needed for the application. 
                    The solution was the porting of the app from the ‘Mobile armory’ to the ‘World of Warcraft: Companion App’ 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="box" id="p2">
                <p>
                    On August 13, 2018, the Companion App made its debut on the App Store. This app was designed as a ‘home away from home’ 
                    interface for World of Warcraft players to keep track of some of their character's main progression systems, interact with 
                    other players, and even participate in the economy of the game from a mobile device. It included many new features not seen 
                    on the companion app like being able to interact with certain special quests that actually existed in the game, or buying and 
                    selling items on the in-game auction house. All of these new features were already seen in Wow, helping the app to further 
                    the similarities between the two games.

                <p>
                    This companion app was a strong step in the right direction for the development of mobile applications in the realm of Warcraft. 
                    However, as developers continued to work on systems upgrades for the software, it became apparent that they were facing some constraints during development.

                <blockquote>
                    “The Companion App was originally designed to support one expansion: Legion. Leading up to Battle for Azeroth, we made the decision to prioritize several major 
                    back-end improvements [...] The tradeoff was that we weren’t able to build out the kind of framework that would be necessary to support more than one expansion 
                    at a time — so we swapped the single expansion that the app supported from Legion to the latest expansion, Battle for Azeroth."

                <p>
                    One of the most significant constraints faced by developers was the inevitable refactoring of the main code base for this application. 
                    The way the application was currently working, developers would essentially override the code each time a new expansion (major game patch) 
                    was released. In practice, this worked, but it meant that the Companion App only supported the current expansion of World of Warcraft. 
                    This proved to be an issue to the community because many players were still invested in quests and missions from previous expansions and 
                    were hoping to continue to engage with them on the mobile platform.

                    Examing the similarites between the Companion App and the base game, it is obvous that there is more here to unpack than with the Mobile Armory. To begin,
                    World of Warcraft and World of Warcraft: Companion App, share lots of the same assets. Moreover, the larger and more important similarity that these two applications share
                    is the player interaction aspect. The Companion App allows players to communicate with people on thier friends list and also people in thier guild (small in game community that often do events together)
                    this is an imporant aspect of any online MMORPG that the Companion App was able to incorporate rather well. Another strong similarity that these games share is the ability to participate in the 
                    online auction house from the Companion App. This allowed players that werre heavily invested in the current markets on World of Warcraft to participate within in them from anywhere, as long as they had 
                    access to a mobile device and an internet connection.

                <p>               
                    The differencs between World of Warcraft and its Companion App are less significant than the Mobile Armory, but still imporant and stark enought to mention. First, like any of the other applications
                    mentioned in this piece, it important to note that the idea of fully recreating World of Warcraft on a mobile device is impractical and challenging. In the opinion of this paper, the developers at Blizzard
                    decided that it would be smart to attempt to incorporate small aspects of World of Warcraft into mobile applications. With any porting of this nature, its known that there will be many large features missing from the applicaiton being created.
                    So, it should come as no suprise to the reader that the Companion App was in no means a replacement to the game, but more a quality of life improvement to some of the games systems.

                    As the years continued, mobile application and game development skyrocketed and the technology followed. On May 3rd, 2022, Blizzard announced plans to begin 
                    developing Warcraft Arclight Rumble. Drawing inspiration from tower defense games and ostensibly the wildly successful Starcraft and Starcraft II, Warcraft Rumble 
                    was designed as a mobile action strategy game set within the Warcraft universe.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="box" id="p2">
                <p>                    
                    Warcraft Rumble is played by collecting character tokens that you can guide through battle in ‘frantic melle skirmishes’. As you play, 
                    you gather resources and use gold reserves to deploy the collected ‘minis’ strategically. As time progresses you gain gold. This is done passively, by mining, or by collecting treasure.
                    The game allows you to customize your active roster by selecting leaders which possess special abilities. The game features a rich progression system tied into collecting more 
                    characters, leveling up your army points, and unlocking new challenges.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box" id="p2">
                <p>                    
                    Warcraft Rumble made the next big advancement in terms of similarity to World of Warcraft. First, it is a playable game, which is a large step up from the Mobile Armory’ and the Companion App. 
                    Second, it features characters, spell names, combat animations, locations, and much more that is directly from World of Warcraft.

            <div class="box" id="p2">
                <p>                    
                    Much of the similarities between the two games can largely be attributed to the advancements in game technology on mobile devices. Not only were mobile devices now 
                    containing hardware that could withstand heavier loads from games that packed a data-heavy punch, but the in-house game engine that Blizzard was using to make the 
                    the game was much more developed than it was many years ago for the launch of the Mobile Armory.

                    Looking more closely at the in-game similarities, one stands out among the rest. It is another key aspect of MMORPGs, that World of Warcraft defines well: 
                    social interaction. Players can communicate with each other through in-game messaging systems. They can form alliances, join guilds, participate in group 
                    activities such as raids or dungeons, and compete against each other in player-versus-player (PvP) combat. Warcraft Rumble also smartly includes many of 
                    these features, such as chat, guilds, and leaderboards.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="box" id="p2">
                <p>                     
                    Examining the differences between the two games can be done by first exploring the two genres that each game defines. World of Warcraft, on computer, 
                    is largely an MMORPG or Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game. These games are a genre of video game that combines elements of role-playing games 
                    or RPGs, with online multiplayer gameplay. They are usually played by large numbers of people simultaneously over the internet, where players are given 
                    the opportunity to interact with each other in real time. Conversely, Warcraft Rumble is a Mobile Action Strategy Game, this is a type of video game designed 
                    specifically for mobile devices. The ‘vanilla’ game boasts a single-player campaign, as opposed to any form of multiplayer environment as facilitated in World of Warcraft. 
                    However, it is important to note that there is a PVP game mode on Warcraft Rumble. This gives the essence of multiplayer content, as you can face off against other players, 
                    but does not come close to the realities of content defined under the MMORPG genre. World of Warcraft features various RPG-specific mechanics such as character creation and 
                    development, questing, exploration, and combat. Players typically control a character avatar within the game world, which they can customize and improve over time by gaining 
                    experience points, leveling up, and acquiring new abilities or equipment. World of Warcraft has a persistent game world that exists and evolves even when individual players are 
                    offline. Changes made by players, such as completing quests or building structures, are often reflected in the game world and can affect other players. Warcraft Rumble largely 
                    features real-time gameplay mechanics and strays off course when tasked with persistence in the environment; it simply is not designed in that manner.
                </p>
            </div>
           
            <div class="box" id="p2">
                <p>                     
                    Quite honestly the most important difference between the two games is their business model. World of Warcraft is a subscription-based game. This means that players pay a monthly 
                    subscription to access the game's content. In addition to this, World of Warcraft releases ‘expansion packs’ bi-annually. These packs are an upgrade to the base game and contain 
                    all of the recently developed features and content for the game. The model heavily relies on and incentivizes its players to purchase these expansions, as the game developers emphasize
                    the content shift from expansion to expansion.
                </p>

            <div class="box" id="p2">
                <p>                     
                    Warcraft Rumble, on the other hand, is free to play as a base game, and will most likely remain like that for the foreseeable future. It collects its income through the 
                    in-game shop which sells new collectibles as well as experience and energy booster packs. Collectively, these games have stark differences in their business and revenue generation models.

            </div>

            <div class="box" id="p2">
                <p>
                    When examining the affordances and constraints of developing Warcraft Rumble, affordances certainly outshine constraints. The app was largely developed in 2021 and has a strong backbone of recent 
                    technology behind it. This allows it to implement many different features and assets with little to no platform constraint. A large factor in this is also the hardware affordances defined in recent years. 
                    People can expect their mobile devices to have upwards of 8 gigabytes of RAM and ample storage space. In addition, many of the new phones have processors that compete with or outperform many computer chips
                    from earlier years. For example, The iPhone 4S scored around 217 in single-core performance and 409 in multi-core performance on the Geekbench 3 benchmark test, while the iPhone 12 Pro's A14 Bionic chip 
                    demonstrates roughly 19 times the single-core performance and 34 times the multi-core performance of the iPhone 4S's A5 chip. These constraints of mobile hardware and the rate at which they improve largely 
                    determine the quality of software that can be produced on it. Warcraft Rumble was developed using the latest technology and should not be facing any constraints relative to the platform it was designed for.

                <p>
                    Reflecting on the analysis done over the course of the paper it is important to begin first where we started. The birth of World of Warcraft sparked a global fascination with the fantasy genre that was the 
                    Warcraft series. Players from every edge of the world amassed online to form alliances and pursue the challenges that the game proposed. The game development team aimed to further develop the Warcraft universe 
                    by making it more accessible to players, especially when they were not using their computers. So the Mobile armory was developed. While it faced some initial constraints and shared little initial similarity 
                    with World of Warcraft, the software prevailed and was updated countless times, before being ultimately ported to the Companion App. This variant of the mobile Warcraft application had many more similarities 
                    to the actual game itself, including quest interaction and real-time auction/market feedback. The development of the companion app was hindered by the lack of maintenance on the preexisting code base but 
                    eventually was dealt with and faced little constraint after the matter. Finally, Blizzard launched Warcraft Rumble in 2023, fully encapsulating the affordances of the mobile platform in recent years. This 
                    game captures the essence of World of Warcraft, from characters and lore to dungeons and gameplay. While the core of Warcraft Rumle is a mobile action strategy. Much of the game base very much feels like
